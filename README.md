## üß† How Spotify Support Works

When you input a Spotify **track**, **album**, or **playlist** link, the bot uses the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/) to retrieve song titles and artists, then **searches YouTube** for playable matches using `yt-dlp`.

- Only the first **15 tracks** are queued for albums/playlists (can be adjusted).
- Purely search-based: there‚Äôs no direct streaming from Spotify.

---

## üêû Troubleshooting

- **Nothing plays?**
  - Make sure your bot has permission to **join and speak** in the voice channel.
  - Check that **FFmpeg** is correctly installed.

- **Spotify errors?**
  - Double-check your **client ID/secret**.
  - Ensure the Spotify API is accessible.

- **Command not working?**
  - Use `/` to see registered commands.
  - Try restarting the bot to re-sync slash commands.
